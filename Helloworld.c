  // the brackets to the printf function and it is going to print them to the screen.
	getch(); // We use this to see the string before the application turns off. This is the first glance that "computers" are not 
  // human beings they DO NOT always share the same common already coded knowledge like "hmm. if i just printf this string it is going to stand here until anything comes out." No it won't.
